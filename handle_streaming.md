I'll help you modify your code to handle the streaming output from Ollama and render it properly in the browser. Let's look at how to adapt both the backend and frontend to handle streaming.

## Understanding the Issue

Your Ollama API is returning a stream of JSON objects, but your current code is expecting a single response. To fix this, we need to:

1. Update the server to use streaming API endpoints and pipe the stream to the client
2. Modify the client to consume the stream and progressively update the UI

Let's implement these changes:

## Explanation of Changes

To properly handle the streaming output from your local LLM via Ollama, I've made significant changes to both your server and client code. Let me explain each component:

### 1. Server-side Changes (server.js)

In the updated server.js:

- **Enabling Streaming**: I've modified the request to Ollama to include `stream: true` parameter and set `responseType: 'stream'` in the axios options.
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Set up proper headers for SSE to maintain an open connection between the server and client.
- **Chunk Processing**: The server now processes each chunk from Ollama and forwards it to the client in real-time using the SSE format (`data: [chunk]\n\n`).
- **Stream Management**: Added proper event handlers for the stream end and error conditions.

### 2. Client-side Changes (script.js)

For the client side:

- **Stream Consumption**: The script now properly reads the SSE stream using the Fetch API with stream handling.
- **Progressive Updates**: Each chunk from the stream is parsed, and the response is incrementally built and displayed in the UI.
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling for various failure points in the streaming process.

## How It Works

1. **Request Initiation**:
   - The client sends a POST request with the prompt.
   - The server forwards this to Ollama with streaming enabled.

2. **Stream Processing**:
   - Ollama begins generating tokens and sending them as JSON objects.
   - The server receives these objects and forwards them to the client as SSE events.

3. **Client Rendering**:
   - The client reads each event, extracts the response token.
   - These tokens are concatenated to build the complete response.
   - The UI is updated in real-time, showing the response as it's generated.

4. **Stream Completion**:
   - When Ollama finishes generating, the server sends a `[DONE]` event.
   - The client closes the connection and displays the final complete response.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Real-time Feedback**: Users see the response as it's being generated, providing immediate feedback.
2. **Efficiency**: No need to wait for the entire response before showing something to the user.
3. **Resource Management**: Properly manages connections and cleans up when done.

## Alternative Implementation

If you prefer a simpler implementation using EventSource (which is specifically designed for SSE), I've included that alternative in the initial version of the updated script. However, the final version uses Fetch API with stream processing, which gives you more control over the connection and error handling.
